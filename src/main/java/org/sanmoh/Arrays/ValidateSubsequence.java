 * Validate Subsequence
 *
 * <h2>Problem Statement
 *
 * <p>Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second
 * array is a subsequence of the first one.
 *
 * <p>A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array
 * but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers.
 *
 * <h3>Sample Input
 *
 * <pre>
 *     array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
 *     sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
 *
 * <h3>Sample Output
 *
 * <pre>
 *     true
