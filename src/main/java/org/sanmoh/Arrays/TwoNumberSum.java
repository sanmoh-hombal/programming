/**
 * <h1>Two Number Sum
 *
 * <h2>Problem Statement
 *
 * <p>Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer
 * representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the
 * function should return them in an array, in any order. If no two numbers sum up to the target
 * sum, the function should return an empty array.
 *
 * <p>Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array;
 * you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
 *
 * <h3>Sample Input
 *
 * <pre>
 *     array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
 *     targetSum = 10
 *
 * <h3>Sample Output
 *
 * <pre>
 *     [-1, 11] // the numbers could be in reverse order
